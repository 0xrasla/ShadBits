# This is a CODEOWNERS file.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
* @global-owner1 @global-owner2

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
*.js    @js-owner
*.ts    @ts-owner
*.tsx   @ts-owner

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
/src/components/ui/ @ui-owner
/src/components/custom/ @custom-components-owner

# In this example, @doctrine-owner owns any files in the /doctrine
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
/src/lib/ @lib-owner
